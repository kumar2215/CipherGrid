## CipherGrid: Privacy policy

Welcome to the CipherGrid app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Kumaraguru. The source code is available on GitHub under the Apache2 License - see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/kumar2215/CipherGrid/blob/master/LICENSE) file for details.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by the user is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either. The app can work without the need for the internet too as it makes no use of it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on this GitHub repo, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Kumaraguru
